## Measure

* All code and documentation MUST be in English.
* Any translation MUST be up to date with the English version and vice-versa.
* There SHOULD be no acronyms, abbreviations, puns or legal/domain specific terms in the codebase without an explanation preceding it or a link to an explanation.
* The name of the project or codebase SHOULD be descriptive and free from acronyms, abbreviations, puns or branding for names.
* Any code, documentation and tests MAY have a translation.

## What this does

* Make your codebase and what it does understandable for a wider variety of stakeholders in multiple contexts.
* Helps with the discoverability of your codebase.

## What this doesnâ€™t do

## How to test

* See if translations and the English version have the same content
* Validate that no unexplained acronyms, abbreviations, puns or legal/domain specific terms are in the documentation
