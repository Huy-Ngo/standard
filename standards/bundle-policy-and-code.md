# Bundle policy and source code

## Measure

* A codebase MUST include all the policy that source code is based upon
* A codebase MUST include all source code that the policy is based upon
* All policy and source code that the codebase is based upon MUST be documented, reusable and portable
* Policy SHOULD be provided in machine readable and unambiguous formats
* Continuous integration tests SHOULD validate the source code and the policy are executed coherently

## What this does

* Make sure that when a public organisation re-uses codebases that they are able to do this effectively since they have access to both the source as well as the civic code necessary

* Make sure a public organisation that re-uses codebases can do this effectively because they have access to both the source and civic code necessary


## What this doesnâ€™t do

## How to test

## Policy makers: what you need to do

* Develop policy with the same version control and documentation mechanisms that are used to develop source code
* Develop policy in formats that are unambiguous and machine readable such as Business Process Model Notation, Decision Model Notion and Case Management Model Notation
* Try to periodically understand what the non-policy code in the codebase does

## Management: what you need to do

* Involve policy makers, developers and designers and keep them connected throughout the whole development process
* Make sure policy makers, developers and designers they are working on the same objectives
