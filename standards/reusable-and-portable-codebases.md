# Create reusable and portable code

## Measure

* The code MUST be developed in order to be reusable in different contexts
* Code SHOULD be general purpose and SHOULD be configurable
* Code and its documentation SHOULD not contain situation-specific information. For example, personal and organisational data as well as tokens and passwords should never be included.
* The codebase MUST be independent from any secret, proprietary or non-Open-licenced code or services for execution and understanding
* The codebase MUST be independent from any secret, proprietary or non-Open-licenced code or services for execution and understanding
* The codebase MUST be developed in order to be reusable in different contexts

## What this does

* Enables other policy makers, developers and designers to reuse whatever you've developed, to test it, to improve it and contribute those improvements back leading to better quality, cheaper maintainability and higher reliability
* More general code is easier to understand for new people that have to work with the code.
* Understanding and reflection as to how codebases can be reused makes it easier to control the scope, mission and vision of the codebase.

## What this doesnâ€™t do

* Get others to reuse the codebase
* Build a community

## How to test

* Ask someone in a similar position in another context to tell you whether they could reuse your Codebase and what that would entail

## Policy makers: what you need to do

* Develop policy that is well documented and can be understood separate from the context

## Management: what you need to do

* Make sure that stakeholders and business owners understand that reusability is an explicit goal of the project as it reduces technical debt and provides sustainability for the codebase

## Developers and designers: what you need to do

* Source should be designed for reuse by other users and organizations
* Source should be designed to solve a general problem instead of a specific one
* if someone in a similar organization faces a similar problem they should be able to use your solution
