# Be open to contributions and collaboration

## Measure


* The codebase MUST have a public issue tracker that allows suggestions from anyone
* The codebase MUST allow anyone to submit suggestions for changes to the codebase
* The documentation MUST link to both the public issue tracker and submitted codebase changes
* The codebase MUST include an email address for security issues and responsible disclosure
* The codebase SHOULD have a publicly available roadmap
* The codebase SHOULD advertise the committed engagement of involved organisations in the development and maintenance
* The codebase MAY document the governance of the codebase, contributions and its community, for example in a `GOVERNANCE` file

## What this does

* Allows collaborative uptake of shared digital infrastructure
* Prevents forks of codebases, in which a community that works on a project splits because there is no shared progress
* Helps users decide to use one codebase over another
* Enables users to fix problems and add features to the shared codebase leading to better, more reliable and feature rich software

## What this doesnâ€™t do

* Get others to reuse the codebase

## How to test

## Policy makers: what you need to do

## Management: what you need to do

* Add to the documentation: how your organisation is involved in the project, what resources it has available for it and for how long

## Developers and designers: what you need to do
