# Document objectives

## Measure

* The codebase MUST contain documentation on its objectives – like a mission and goal statement – that is understandable for designers and developers so that they can use or contribute to the codebase 
* The codebase SHOULD contain documentation on its objectives understandable by policy makers and management
* The codebase MAY contain documentation on its objectives for the general public

## What this does

* Provide an easy way for people to decide whether this codebase is interesting for them now, and in the future
* Help scope your own development as well as clearly communicate to other stakeholders and contributors what the codebase is for

## What this doesn’t do

* Guarantee contributions to your codebase
* Reduce the need for clear documentation throughout your codebase 

## How to test

* Find an entry for the codebase objectives, mission or goal in the codebase documentation

## Policy makers: what you need to do

* Add the policy objectives to the codebase documentation, for instance in the `README`

## Management: what you need to do

* Add the organisational and business objectives to the codebase documentation, for instance in the `README`

## Developers and designers: what you need to do

* Add the technology and design objectives to the codebase documentation, for instance in the `README`
