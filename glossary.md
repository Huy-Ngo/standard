# Glossary

## Code

Any explicitly described system of rules. This includes civil code – such as laws, policy and ordinances – as well as source code that is used to build software. Both of these are rules, some executed by humans and others by machines.

## Codebase

Any discrete package of code (both source and policy), the tests and the documentation required to implement a piece of policy or software.

This can be – for example – a document or a version-control repository.

## Continous Integration

Continous Integration: In software engineering, continuous integration (CI) is the practice of merging all developers' working copies to a development branch of a codebase as frequently as reasonable. 

## General public

The public at large: end users of the code and the services based upon it.

For example, a city's residents are considered end users of a city's services and of all code that powers these services.

## Open source

Open source is defined by the Open Source Initiative in their [Open Source Definition](https://opensource.org/osd-annotated).

## Open standard

An open standard is any standard that meets the Open Source Initiative's [Open Standard Requirements](https://opensource.org/osr).

## Policy

A policy is a deliberate system of principles to guide decisions and achieve rational outcomes.
A policy is a statement of intent, and is implemented as a procedure or protocol.
Policies are generally adopted by a governance body within an organization.
Policies can assist in both subjective and objective decision making.

Public policy is the process by which governments translate their political vision into programmes and actions to deliver outcomes.

In the Standard the word 'policy' refers to policy created and adopted by public organizations such as governments and municipalities.

## Public code

Public code is both civil code (like policy or regulation) and computer source code (such as software and algorithms) executed in a public context, by humans or machines.

Because public code serves the public interest, it should be open, legible, accountable, accessible and sustainable.

By developing public code independently from but still implementable in the local context for which it was developed, as well as documenting the development process openly, public code can provide a building block for others to:

* re-implement in their local context
* take as a starting point to continue development
* use as a basis for learning

To facilitate re-use, public code should be either released into the public domain or licensed with an open license that permits others to view and reuse the work freely and to produce derivative works.

## Repository

In revision (or version) control systems, a repository is a data structure which stores metadata for a set of files or directory structure. (source: SVNBook)

## Version control

A component of software configuration management, version control, also known as revision control or source control, is the management of changes to documents, computer programs, large web sites, and other collections of information. Changes are usually identified by a number or letter code, termed the "revision number", "revision level", or simply "revision". For example, an initial set of files is "revision 1". When the first change is made, the resulting set is "revision 2", and so on. Each revision is associated with a timestamp and the person making the change. Revisions can be compared, restored, and with some types of files, merged. (source: Fowler, Martin (1 May 2006). "Continuous Integration". martinfowler.com. Retrieved 9 January 2014.)
