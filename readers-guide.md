# Readers guide

Each of the criteria of the standard have a few sections that are meant to make it clear how to create great public code.

## Requirements

This section lists what needs to be done in order to comply with the standard.

In order to limit ambiguity, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [IETF RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

## What this does

Why it is important for the users and contributors of this codebase that these requirements are followed.

## What this does not do

This is expectation management, knowing what following the requirements can't save you from is often a crucial aspect of applying them correctly as well as making sure no unexpected things pop-up suddenly.

## How to test

This section offers actions you can take to see if a contribution is compliant with the standard. This is key if you want to operationalize the standard.

We've tried to word it so that also someone who is not intimately acquainted with the subject matter can still do a basic check for compliance.

## Policy makers: what you need to do

This section tries to specifically speak to policy makers by offering them concrete actions they can perform in their role.

Policy makers are usually less technologically able but often set the priorities and goals of projects.

## Management: what you need to do

This section tries to specifically speak to management by offering them concrete actions they can perform in their role.

Management is responsible for projects to be done in time, stakeholder management as well as the continued delivery of service. For this they are wholly reliant on both the policy makers as well as the developers and designers. They need to create the right culture, get the right resources in line and provide the right structures to deliver great services.

## Developers and designers: what you need to do

This section tries to specifically speak to developers and designers by offering them concrete actions they can perform in their role.

Developers are usually a bit more technically aligned and have more impact on the delivery of services than the previous groups.

For those that are still interested after reading prior points and that want to know more about why these requirements are in place and how to make them work for them.
