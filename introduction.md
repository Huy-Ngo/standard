# Introduction

The Standard for Public Code is a method for developing civic and source code for public purposes.

We define ‘public code’ as open source software developed by public public organisations, together with the policy and guidance needed for reuse.

The [Foundation for Public Code](https://publiccode.net/) helps public organisations share and adopt open source software, build sustainable developer communities and create a thriving ecosystem for public code.

## The goals for the Standard

The Standard:
    * guides organisations to the criteria they need to meet for their code to be included for Foundation stewardship
    * provides reassurance that all code under Foundation stewardship is high quality and reusable

* The Standard for Public Code does this by:
    * setting out a common terminology for public code development
    * establishing measures to help develop high quality public code
    * providing guidance on how to implement the standards

## Who this is for

The Standard for Public Code is for the people who create and reuse public code:

* policy makers
* business and project management
* developers and designers

These people work at:

* public organisations: institutions and administrations
* vendors of policy and information technology to public organisations

It is not aimed at residents and citizens, journalists or academics.
