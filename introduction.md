# Introduction

The Standard for Public Code is a method for developing civic and source code for public purposes.

We define ‘public code’ as open source software developed by public administrations (like cities), together with the policy and guidance needed for reuse.

The Foundation for Public Code helps cities share and adopt open source software, build sustainable developer communities and create a thriving ecosystem for public code.

The Standard:
    * guides cities to the criteria they need to meet for their code to be included for Foundation stewardship
    * provides reassurance that all code under Foundation stewardship is high quality and reusable

## The goals for the Standard

The Standard for Public Code gives cities a model for building their own open source solutions to enable successful future reuse by other cities. It includes guidance for policymakers, city administrators, developers and vendors.


* Function as a *Standard* for public code
    * Set out a common terminology for public code development
    * Measures that can help develop high quality public code
    * Guidance on how to implement the standards


## Who is this guidance for

This guide is for:

* policy makers
* business and project management
* developers and designers

Working at:

* public organisations: institutions and administrations
* vendors of policy and information technology to public organisations

It is not aimed at residents and citizens, journalists or academics.
