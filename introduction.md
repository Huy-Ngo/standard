# Introduction

The Standard for Public Code is a method for developing civic and source code for public purposes.

We define ‘public code’ as open source software developed by public public organisations, together with the policy and guidance needed for reuse.

The [Foundation for Public Code](https://publiccode.net/) helps public organisations share and adopt open source software, build sustainable developer communities and create a thriving ecosystem for public code.

## The goals for the Standard

The Standard:

* guides organisations to the criteria they need to meet for their code to be included for Foundation stewardship
* provides reassurance that all code under Foundation stewardship is high quality and reusable

* The Standard for Public Code does this by:

  * setting out a common terminology for public code development
  * establishing measures to help develop high quality public code
  * providing guidance on how to implement the standards

## Who this is for

The Standard for Public Code is for the people who create and reuse public code:

* policy makers
* business and project management
* developers and designers

These people work at:

* public organisations: institutions and administrations
* vendors of policy and information technology to public organisations

It is not aimed at public organisations' end users (residents or citizens), journalists or academics.

## Background (why use public code!)

In the public context in the 21st century, software can be considered vital infrastructure. It mediates/governs the expression of policy - and where it learns to make its own decisions (for example machine learning algorithms), it is potentially writing new policy.

We hold that software and policy are both code. The former executed by machines and the latter by humans.

This leads to a number of new concerns.

### Sovereignty

* Preferable economic model
  * More vendors necessary due to growing demand of digitalisation

### The difference between private and public technologies

* Procurement and its effects
* Why have control
  * De-risking infrastructure
  * Sustainability
* Commodity versus specialistic code
  * Reducing technical debt
* Core values
  * Inclusive, usable, open, legible, accountable, accessible and sustainable

### Collaboration between (public) organisations and the pooling of resources

* What is important to take into account when writing public policy for the digital age
* What is important to take into account when writing software for a public goal

## Procuring public code

You don't need to change your technology suppliers or procurement process to use public code. It can be used by your permanent in-house development team, contractors or outsourced suppliers. Vendors to public organisations can include public code in their bids for contracts.

To use existing public code, you need to specify in your budget and project design that your new solution will use that codebase. To encourage an innovative approach to adapting the public code to your context, you could describe the service or outcome in your contract.

You don't need to ask us to use the code, but of course, we would like to know!

To build new public code for contribution to Foundation for Public Code stewardship, you'll need to:

* meet the Standard for Public Code as you plan and develop your code
* have your code certified by the Foundation for Public Code

## Certification of public code

The Foundation for Public Code will start certifying codebases after it launches in summer 2019. We'll add more information about how to work with us then. Watch this space!
